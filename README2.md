The file pt.py is an attempt to make the GUI for the Tambola game.

But as I used pyQt5 for the GUI it has gotten way to complex. So, I am planning to discontinue this attempt and probably try with a different module.

The whole UI for the app has been made but the only thing that remains is the backend work, which in pyQT5 is very compex.

Please checkout pt.py and tell me if you figure out how to work with the backend with PyQT5.
