This is a program that lets you play tambola without the need for a person to narrate the numbers...
It uses google TTS to speak the numbers.
This is open for changes.

To execute the .py file, run it in a python termianl after installing some pip packages:

pip install gtts,

pip install vlc,

pip install keyboard

There are two vesions of the program:
Tambola.py is the first non optimised one and was the first build of the project.

Tambola2.py is the more optimised and fixed version with additional features.

The file pt.py is an attempt to make the GUI for the Tambola game.

But as I used pyQt5 for the GUI it has gotten way to complex. So, I am planning to discontinue this attempt and probably try with a different module.

The whole UI for the app has been made but the only thing that remains is the backend work, which in pyQT5 is very compex.

Please checkout pt.py and tell me if you figure out how to work with the backend with PyQT5.
